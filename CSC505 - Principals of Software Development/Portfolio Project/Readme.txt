In order to log into the ATM, you will need to provide the Card Number and the Pin.

Since typically, the Bank Member does not have the option to select the card number to be used, the bank will create the card number that is randomly generated. 

At the start of the execution, the Account information for the two Bank members are displayed. 

Bank Member 1:
	Name: Mr. Moneybags
	Card Number: (Observe the printed Card Number at execution)
	PIN: 9876
	Initial Balance: 1,000,000

Bank Member 1:
	Name: Forgetful Fran
	Card Number: (Observe the printed Card Number at execution)
	PIN: 1234
	Initial Balance: 1

*** In the real world, the ATM would not be displaying other's Bank Account and Card information, but for the purposes of interacting with this Solution, it is provided. ***
